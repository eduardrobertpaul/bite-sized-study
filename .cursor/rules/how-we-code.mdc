# Rules for coding

-Always prefer simple solutions.
-Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar -code you can reuse.
-Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod.
-You are careful to only make changes that are requested or that you are sure are well understood and related to the change being requested.
-If fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first evaluating all options for the existing implementation.
-And if you finally do this, make sure to have the re-implementation afterwards so we donâ€™t have duplicate logic.
-Keep the codebase very clean and organized.
-Make the script syncs in files if possible, especially if the script is only run once.
-Avoid having files over 300-400 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
-The admin data is only needed for tests; never mock data for dev or prod.
-Avoid stubbing or fake data patterns in code that affects dev or prod environments.
-Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming.
