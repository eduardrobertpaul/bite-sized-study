This app is a platform where users can upload their university course materials, and then an integrated LLM automatically generates quizzes (in easy, medium, and hard difficulty), flashcards, and other study aids. The goal is to help students quickly master their course content through personalized, AI-driven learning resources.

1. Upload & Storage

Provide an “Upload Materials” form.
Accept PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.
Extract raw text from uploads and store it in a database or file system.
2. Text Preprocessing

Clean and split the text into manageable chunks.
Remove boilerplate (headers, footers, etc.).
Tag or index sections (chapters, headings) for later reference.
3. LLM Integration

Send preprocessed chunks to an LLM via an API.
Get summarized data and semantic embeddings (if useful).
Store all responses in a structured format for easy retrieval.
4. Quiz Generation

Request multiple sets of quiz questions from the LLM (easy, medium, hard).
Format them as Q&A pairs, multiple-choice, or other question types.
Store generated quizzes in the database, tied to the original course material.
5. Flashcard Creation

Ask the LLM for condensed Q&A flashcards.
Generate both short-answer and definition-style cards.
Keep them in a separate but related table for easy retrieval.
6. Other Learning Techniques

Prompt the LLM to create summaries, mind maps, or practice exercises.
Optionally implement spaced-repetition logic for scheduling.
Provide an interface to mark progress (e.g., “I got it” or “Review later”).
7. User Interface

Show a dashboard listing uploaded materials.
Let users select a material and choose “Quizzes” or “Flashcards.”
Display quiz results and track user performance.
Provide simple navigation for the different learning tools.
8. Testing & Validation

Write automated tests to verify file upload, text parsing, LLM calls, and quiz generation.
Validate correctness of the LLM’s output (basic checks on format and presence of questions/answers).
9. Deployment & Maintenance

Set up an environment for running the app (local dev, test, prod).
Automate builds, run tests, and deploy.
Monitor logs and usage for errors or performance issues.
10. Iteration & Improvements

Gather user feedback on question difficulty, flashcard quality, and overall experience.
Tweak prompts or add additional LLM-based features.
Enhance UI to support more advanced study modes (e.g., timed quizzes, random question sets).
